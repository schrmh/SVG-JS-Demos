## SVG & Javascript

Examples and expanded demos from instructional videos provided on my YouTube channel. Programming here is specifically Javascript, tied with libraries or SVGs. I also play a fair amount with Python, but don't currently have any of that shown here.

Even if you dont know the answers, answer through and check out the results page.
